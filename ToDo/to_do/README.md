# Flutter-ToDo

**A First Baby Step..**

ToDo - A very simple app, developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to explore flutter framework and it's concepts.

Myself - a JAVA developer and I don't have much experience in native app development. This is like my first baby step towards hybrid application development for Andriod, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, WearOS etc. using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

A big shout out to the [Flutter Community](https://flutter.dev/community) people for their help and support.
